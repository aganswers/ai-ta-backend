# Google Drive Integration - Complete Implementation

## ‚úÖ Status: PRODUCTION READY

The Google Drive integration is fully implemented and tested. Users can now share Google Drive files with their projects by simply sharing them to a project-specific email address, and agents can access and analyze those files.

---

## üéØ Overview

When a project is created, a Google Group is automatically created for it. Users share their Google Drive files to this group email, and the backend uses Domain-Wide Delegation to access those files on behalf of `admin@aganswers.ai`.

---

## üîë Key Features

### 1. **Automatic Group Creation**
- When a project is created, a Google Group is automatically created
- Group email format: `<sanitized-project-name>@aganswers.ai`
- Example: Project "My Farm" ‚Üí `my-farm@aganswers.ai`
- **Admin membership**: `admin@aganswers.ai` is automatically added as a MEMBER to every group
- Retry logic handles eventual consistency delays (up to 5 retries with exponential backoff)

### 2. **File Sharing Flow**
- Project dashboard displays the group email
- Users share Google Drive files/folders with the group email
- Backend automatically detects and loads shared files
- Supports: Google Sheets (exported as CSV), CSV files

### 3. **Agent Integration**
- Base agent receives a list of available files in its instruction
- File queries are routed to the `file_agent`
- Both CSV files (from R2) and Google Drive files are loaded into pandas DataFrames
- Agent can analyze, visualize, and answer questions about the data

### 4. **Security & Access Control**
- All access happens through Domain-Wide Delegation
- Service account impersonates `admin@aganswers.ai`
- Files are scoped to the requesting project's group
- No user re-authentication required

## üîß Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Already configured in /etc/aganswers/
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE="/etc/aganswers/service-account.json"
ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@aganswers.ai"
DOMAIN="aganswers.ai"
```

### Required Google API Scopes

ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN group_email TEXT;
```

## üöÄ Usage Example

### For Users

1. **Create a project** (or use existing project with group_email)
2. **View the project dashboard** - see the group email
3. **Share a Google Sheet** to that email (e.g., `my-farm@aganswers.ai`)
4. **Ask the agent**: "What files do we have?"
   - Response: "We have the following files: üìä fruit"
5. **Ask about the data**: "What is in the fruit file?"
   - Agent loads the file and analyzes it

### For Developers

```python
# Create a group programmatically
from ai_ta_backend.integrations.google_groups import GoogleGroupsService

service = GoogleGroupsService()
group_email = service.create_project_group("My Farm Project")
# Returns: "my-farm-project@aganswers.ai"
# Admin is automatically a member

# Ensure admin membership (retroactive)
service.ensure_admin_is_member(group_email)

# List files shared with group
files = service.list_files_shared_with_group(group_email)

# Load Drive files for a project
from ai_ta_backend.agents.tools.drive.agent import load_drive_files_for_project
dataframes = load_drive_files_for_project("My Farm Project", group_email)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

### Resolved Issues

- ‚úÖ **Eventual consistency delays**: Fixed with retry logic (exponential backoff)
- ‚úÖ **Group_email stored as JSON string**: Fixed with JSON.loads() handling
- ‚úÖ **Admin not visible immediately**: Handled with retries and wait time

### Current Limitations

1. **Groups Settings API**: Currently disabled in project 789202960149
   - Impact: Group settings cannot be configured programmatically
   - Workaround: Groups work fine with default settings
   - Future: Enable API in Google Cloud Console if needed

2. **Supported File Types**: Currently limited to:
   - Google Sheets (exported as CSV)
   - CSV files
   - Future: Can extend to Google Docs, PDFs, etc.

3. **File Sync**: Not real-time
   - Files are loaded when conversation starts
   - Future: Implement periodic sync or webhook-based updates

---

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Sync**
   - Implement periodic background sync
   - Use Google Drive Push Notifications (webhooks)

2. **Additional File Types**
   - Google Docs ‚Üí Markdown or plain text
   - PDFs ‚Üí Text extraction
   - Images ‚Üí OCR or vision analysis

3. **File Management UI**
   - List files in dashboard
   - Remove file access
   - View file metadata

4. **Advanced Permissions**
   - Allow project admins to add/remove files
   - Audit log for file access
   - Fine-grained permissions per file

5. **Group Settings UI**
   - Enable Groups Settings API
   - Allow customization of group settings
   - Manage external member access
